A simple functional graph library. Keys used to identify nodes can be any `comparable` and nodes can have any kind of metadata associated with them.

All operations that look at a single node are at most `O(log n)`.
Operations that look at all elements in the graph are at most `O(n log n)`.

{-

   It is theoretically possible to get O(1) path traversals without enforcing a DAG or violating immutability, but that would make all inserts and modifications at least O(n), because all nodes reference all other nodes (except if the graph is disjoint). If I figure out a way to do the conversion in in linear time, I can add that later.
